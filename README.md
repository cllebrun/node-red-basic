Node-RED Bluemix Starter Application
====================================

### Node-RED in IBM Bluemix

This repository is an example Node-RED application that can be deployed into
Bluemix with only a couple clicks. Try it out for yourself right now by clicking:

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cllebrun/node-red-basic.git)

### How does this work?

When you click the button, you are taken to Bluemix where you get a pick a name
for your application at which point the platform takes over, grabs the code from
this repository and gets it deployed.


When you first access the application, you'll be asked to set some security options
to ensure your flow editor remains secure from unauthorised access.

It includes a set of default flows that are automatically deployed the first time
Node-RED runs.

### Customising Node-RED

This repository is here to be cloned, modified and re-used to allow anyone create
their own Node-RED based application that can be quickly deployed to Bluemix.

The web content you get when you go to the application's URL is stored under the
`public` directory.

Additional nodes can be added to the `package.json` file and all other Node-RED
configuration settings can be set in `bluemix-settings.js`.

If you do clone this repository, make sure you update this `README.md` file to point
the `Deploy to Bluemix` button at your repository.
